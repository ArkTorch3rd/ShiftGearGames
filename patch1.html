        <h1>The Eden Patch</h1>
        <p>The patch has been denoted as the "Eden Patch" because of Eden's bugged hitboxes and oversights.</p>
        <p>
            Here are the following issues that have been identified.
            <ol>
                <li>Down special: Royal Decree has a wider hitbox than intended</li>
                <li>2C Heavy: Ejection's hitbox occasionally never registers.</li>
                <li>Hitbox for Finisher: Sanctuary has map-wide coverage.</li>
                <li>Neutral Special: Purifying Fields covers more ground area than intended.</li>
            </ol>
            All but Purifying Fields have been fixed and Purifying Fields has been kept at its current radius.
